## Geography

I live in London. The city of many cultures and colours, which I find extremly staisfying, this city is home to people from almost all over the **world**. I *love* it.

Three of my favourite books

-*Mindstorm* by Seymore Papert
-*Harry Potter* by J K Rowlings
-*The Diary of a Stinky Kid* by Jacquelene Wilson
